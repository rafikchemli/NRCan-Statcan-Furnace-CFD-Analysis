# NRCan-Statcan Furnace CFD Analysis

This repository contains the code and analysis for a collaborative project between Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) and Statistics Canada, focusing on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis of bio-particles in industrial steel furnaces.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to leverage NRCan's comprehensive furnace datasets for advanced analytics to identify the optimal conditions for introducing bio-particles in arc steel furnaces, ultimately reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the steel industry.

## Repository Structure

- **Phase 1**: Initial data exploration and modeling
  - `NRCan_Statcan_CFD_Exploration.ipynb`: Exploratory data analysis of furnace simulation data
  - `NRCan_Statcan_CFD_Modeling.ipynb`: Machine learning models to predict particle behavior
  - `aggregated_processed_data.csv`: Processed dataset used for modeling
  - `best_model.pkl`: Serialized best-performing machine learning model

- **Phase 2**: Advanced clustering and pattern analysis
  - `NRCan_Statcan_CFD_Clustering.ipynb`: Detailed clustering analysis of particle behaviors

- **Applications**:
  - `cfd_clustering_app.py`: Streamlit application for interactive cluster analysis of CFD data
  - `cluster_analysis_app.py`: Streamlit application for exploring silhouette scores and cluster feature analysis
  - `Clustering_figures.py`: Command-line tool for generating publication-quality figures
